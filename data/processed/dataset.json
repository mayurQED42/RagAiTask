    "text": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a comprehensive standard library that provides tools suited to many tasks. Python is widely used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. Popular frameworks include Django for web apps and TensorFlow for machine learning. Developers appreciate Python for its simplicity, versatility, and large supportive community. Its syntax allows developers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to languages like C++ or Java. Despite being interpreted and generally slower than compiled languages, Python's ease of use, flexibility, and rich ecosystem make it one of the most popular languages today."
